    <h1>Linked Lists</h1>
    <p>
      A linked list is a data structure used for organizing and storing a
      collection of elements, called <b>nodes</b>. Unlike arrays, linked lists
      do not store their elements in contiguous memmory locations. Instead, each
      node in a linked list contains <i>2 parts:</i>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The data itself</li>
      <li>A reference (or pointer) to the next node in the list</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      This structure allows for dynamic memory allocation and efficient
      insertion and deletion of elements, making linked lists an important
      concept in computer science and programming
    </p>

    <p>
      There are different types of linked lists, but the two most common types
      are:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Singly Linked List:</b> In a singly linked list, each node has data
        and a reference to the next node. The last node typically points to a
        null value, indicating the end of the list
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Doubly Linked List:</b> In a double linked list, each has data and
        reference to both the next node and the previous node. This
        bidirectional linking allows for efficient traversal in both directions
      </li>
      <p>
        Linked lists are often used when you need to work with data that may
        change in size, as they can dynamically grow or shrink without requiring
        large, contiguous memory blocks. Thery are used in various applications,
        including implementing data structures like stacks, queues, and hash
        tables, as well as in more complex structures like graphs and hash maps
